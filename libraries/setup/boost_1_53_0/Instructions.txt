Boost 1.53.0 Setup Instructions
Last Updated by Stuart Golodetz on 20/05/13
-------------------------------------------

1. Extract boost_1_53_0.tar.gz into the libraries directory.

	On Windows:

	a) Just extract it using something like the shareware version of WinRAR.

	On Linux or Mac:

	a) Change to the libraries directory.
	b) Run "tar xzf setup/boost_1_53_0/boost_1_53_0.tar.gz".

2. Rename the boost_1_53_0 subdirectory of libraries to boost-setup.

3. For Visual Studio 2010 and later only:

	a) Open boost-setup\boost\test\impl\compiler_log_formatter.ipp
	b) Change this line:

	output << "error in \"" << test_phase_identifier() << "\": ";

	to this:

	output << "error : in \"" << test_phase_identifier() << "\": ";

This fixes the problem of test failures not appearing in the error pane (the format changed between Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010).

4. Whilst most of the Boost libraries are header-only (i.e. there's no compilation needed), whery uses some Boost libraries that need compiling: in particular, date_time, filesystem and thread. To compile those libraries, you need to follow the instructions here:

http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/more/getting_started/index.html

(If they're no longer there by this point, the Getting Started instructions for the latest version of Boost will hopefully suffice. Search for it on the main page at www.boost.org.)

Essentially, you need to run the following at the command prompt (from within the boost-setup directory).

Windows (Visual Studio 2010):

bootstrap
b2 -j2 --libdir=..\boost_1_53_0\lib --includedir=..\boost_1_53_0\include --abbreviate-paths --with-chrono --with-date_time --with-filesystem --with-test --with-thread --build-type=complete toolset=msvc-10.0 install

Linux or Mac:

bootstrap
b2 -j2 --libdir=../boost_1_53_0/lib --includedir=../boost_1_53_0/include --abbreviate-paths --with-chrono --with-date_time --with-filesystem --with-test --with-thread --build-type=complete --layout=versioned toolset=gcc install

The -j2 option is added to help improve the speed of the builds; it can be modified/removed as desired.

5. (Optional) Remove the boost-setup directory as it is no longer needed.
